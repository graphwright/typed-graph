# Formal Definitions

This defines the formal model precisely, establishes vocabulary, states hard rules,
and lists explicit non-goals. When in doubt, check against this file before generating
code, prose, or schema definitions.

The notation itself isn't the point — the benefits come from what the process of
formalizing forces, and those benefits survive translation into plain prose.

**It settles ambiguity permanently.** Natural language descriptions of data structures
always leave wiggle room. "Edges have types" could mean a dozen things. A formal
definition closes off all of them at once. Even if readers never see the notation,
the author has made decisions that make every subsequent explanation consistent.

**It separates schema from instance.** The $T$ vs. $V$ split is the single most
important conceptual distinction in the book. A formal definition makes it impossible
to conflate the two.

**It gives you a checklist.** The 4-tuple is a completeness check. If you can't place
something in one of those slots, either it doesn't belong in the model or the model
is missing a slot. That discipline propagates into the code, the explanations, and
the worked examples.

**It anchors the vocabulary.** Once you've defined $\text{Tr}(p)$ formally, "trait"
has a precise meaning for the rest of the book.

**It makes identity unambiguous.** Two instances that represent the same real-world
entity must be distinguishable from two instances that represent the same claim at
different epistemic states. Canonical IDs close off that confusion: each member of
$V$ has a stable, opaque identifier assigned at construction and never derived from
its content. Merging, deduplication, and cross-reference all become well-defined
operations.

**It grounds every claim in its source — and makes ungrounded claims equally
explicit.** A grounded proposition carries a declared provenance sub-schema, so
tracing it back to its origin is a field lookup, not a search. But the graph is also
used to reason about hypotheticals — statements introduced by a reasoner or a user
that never originated in a canonical source. The model does not forbid these; it makes
the distinction unmissable. Every statement either carries a complete provenance record
or is explicitly ungrounded (`provenance is None`), with no partial state in between.
That discipline propagates into ingestion pipelines, dispute resolution, epistemic
audits, and the ability to restrict any query to the grounded subgraph.

## Formal Definition

A typed graph $G$ is a 4-tuple $\mathbf{(T,\ \Phi,\ V,\ \tau)}$ where:

### Schema layer — fixed at graph-design time

- $T$ — finite set of **types**, partitioned into:
  * $T_\text{ent}$ — **entity types** (e.g. Person, Drug, Location)
  * $T_\text{pred}$ — **predicate types** (e.g. Treats, KnewAt, LocatedIn)
- $\Phi: T \to \text{FieldSchema}$ — the **field schema**, mapping each type to a
  Pydantic model declaration of named, typed fields. For predicate types,
  $\Phi$ includes three distinguished fields:
  * `subject` — typed reference to an instance in $V$; the type annotation
    constitutes $\text{dom}(p)$
  * `object_` — typed reference to an instance in $V$; the type annotation
    constitutes $\text{ran}(p)$
  * `truth_status` — the graph's current commitment to the proposition
    this instance expresses
- For each $p \in T_\text{pred}$:
  * $\text{dom}(p) \subseteq T$ — permitted subject types, read from the type
    annotation of `subject` in $\Phi(p)$
  * $\text{ran}(p) \subseteq T$ — permitted object types, read from the type
    annotation of `object_` in $\Phi(p)$
  * $\text{Tr}(p) \subseteq \text{Trait}$ — finite set of semantic traits

The partition is strict: $T_\text{ent} \cap T_\text{pred} = \emptyset$ and
$T_\text{ent} \cup T_\text{pred} = T$. Every type is exactly one of the two;
$\Phi$ determines which, by whether it declares the distinguished fields
`subject`, `object_`, and `truth_status`. Note the asymmetry with the instance
layer: every predicate *instance* is a full member of $V$ ($E \subseteq V$),
but no predicate *type* is an entity *type*. The Python realization mirrors
both facts at once: `EntityInstance` and `BaseStatement` are disjoint siblings
under a common root class `Instance`, which carries membership in $V$ (the
`id` field). $\tau$ assigns each instance its most-derived class, which falls
unambiguously on one side of the partition.

The field schema $\Phi$ is the central structural definition. It defines what each
type IS — including whether a type is a predicate (carries subject/object/truth_status)
or a plain entity (does not). Domain and range constraints, truth semantics, and
field validation all derive from $\Phi$. The graph topology is emergent: it is
recovered by reading the subject/object fields of predicate-typed instances.

### Instance layer — populated at ingestion or reasoning time

- $V$ — set of all **instances** (both entity instances and predicate instances)
- $\tau: V \to T$ — type assignment for all instances

The **edge set** $E$ is derived, not primitive:

$$
E = \{v \in V : \tau(v) \in T_\text{pred}\}
$$

$E \subseteq V$, that is,
every member of $E$ is also a member of $V$. A predicate instance is a full
member of $V$ — it has an id, it can be referenced by other predicate instances
as their subject or object. This is the single relaxation relative to the
classical graph formalism, where $V$ and $E$ are disjoint sorts. It is what
enables higher-order predication without a separate reification mechanism.

### Canonical identity

Each instance $v \in V$ carries a distinguished field $v.\text{id} \in \mathcal{I}$,
where $\mathcal{I}$ is a universe of stable identifiers. The identity axiom requires:

$$\forall\, v, v' \in V:\ v \neq v' \Rightarrow v.\text{id} \neq v'.\text{id}$$

That is, $\text{id}$ is injective on $V$. The identifier is:

- **Assigned at construction** — not derived from any mutable field or external state
- **Stable** — once assigned, it does not change (consistent with R7)
- **Non-dispatch** — the id string is never parsed to recover type; type is the
  exclusive responsibility of $\tau$ and the Python class hierarchy. Human-readable
  id schemes (external ontology keys, corpus-namespaced slugs) are permitted as long
  as no code branches on the string content to determine a type.
- **Ontology-anchored where possible** — for entity instances that correspond to
  real-world referents, the id should be sourced from or aligned with a community-curated
  authoritative ontology (e.g. Wikidata QIDs, MeSH IDs, a domain-specific authority
  such as Baker Street Wiki). Minting ad-hoc IDs for named entities that have
  established canonical IDs elsewhere is a traceability failure.

Display is separate from identity. Instances implement `__str__` to return a
human-readable label — `display_name` for entities that carry one, `description`
or `label` for synthetic entities, and `ClassName(subject → object)` for predicate
instances. This presentation string is one-way: it is generated for human
consumption and is never parsed back to recover an id, type, or field value.

In Python, `Instance.id` is a `str` field (a UUID, an ontology-authority key, or a
corpus-namespaced slug) declared before any domain-specific fields and frozen by the
model configuration.

### Validity constraint

Each instance $v \in V$ carries fields conforming to $\Phi(\tau(v))$.

For predicate instances, this subsumes domain/range enforcement: if $\Phi(p)$
declares `subject: Drug` and `object_: Disease`, then an instance of type $p$
whose subject is a Location fails field validation. No separate domain/range
check is needed.

### Trait vocabulary

$$
\text{Trait} ::= \text{Symmetric} \mid \text{Transitive} \mid \text{Functional} \mid \text{InverseFunctional} \mid \text{Inverse}(p') \mid \text{Rule}(\phi \Rightarrow \psi)
$$

Traits are realized as Python mixin classes inherited alongside the base predicate
class. The unparameterized traits (`Symmetric`, `Transitive`, `Functional`,
`InverseFunctional`) are plain marker classes. `Inverse` is a generic parameterized
by the partner predicate type.

#### Rule(φ ⇒ ψ) — Datalog rules

`Rule(φ ⇒ ψ)` is a **Datalog rule** — a Horn clause restricted to positive,
function-symbol-free literals:

- **φ (body)** — a conjunction of positive graph pattern conditions: variable
  bindings over instances in $V$ that must all hold in the asserted graph
- **ψ (head)** — a single derived predicate instance to assert when φ is satisfied

Formally, a rule with variables $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ has the shape:

$$
p_1(x_{a_1}, x_{b_1}) \wedge \cdots \wedge p_k(x_{a_k}, x_{b_k})\ \Rightarrow\ p_0(x_{a_0}, x_{b_0})
$$

where each $p_i \in T_\text{pred}$ and each $x_j$ ranges over $V$. The Datalog
restrictions — no function symbols, no negation, no existential variables in the
head — keep inference decidable and the semantics clean: rule application is
iterated to a **least fixed point** over the asserted graph. Every derived instance
enters $V$ as a full member with its own id and provenance (R10 applies; the
`extraction_method` is `inferred`).

The named traits are special cases of Datalog rules that the schema can express
without the full `Rule` form:

| Trait | Equivalent rule |
|---|---|
| `Transitive` | $p(x, y) \wedge p(y, z) \Rightarrow p(x, z)$ |
| `Symmetric` | $p(x, y) \Rightarrow p(y, x)$ |
| `Inverse(p')` | $p(x, y) \Rightarrow p'(y, x)$ |

`Rule` is the escape hatch for any inference pattern that does not fit those named
forms — cross-predicate rules, multi-hop chains, or rules with more than two body
literals. Unlike the named traits, `Rule` has no *type-level* expression: it is
realized as ordinary Python objects (`rules.Rule` / `rules.Literal` with named
`rules.Var` variables from `variables("x y z")`), not as a mixin on a predicate
class. The `datalog.Engine` evaluates a set of rules to the least fixed point over
the asserted graph, constructing each derived head through its predicate class so
domain/range are validated (R6) and grounding it with `extraction_method = inferred`.
The named traits are compiled to their equivalent rules by `Engine.add_traits`, so
they and hand-written `Rule`s run through the same evaluator. Rules are built
directly in Python — there is deliberately no text grammar or parser.

### Truth status

Every predicate instance carries a `truth_status` field, whose value is one of:

`asserted_true` | `asserted_false` | `hypothetical` | `disputed` | `retracted`

Under the closed-world assumption, the presence of a predicate instance does NOT
by itself assert the proposition; the `truth_status` field carries the assertion
explicitly. This replaces the classical convention where edge-presence is assertion.

The **asserted graph** — the first-order fact graph available for traversal — is
the projection of $E$ where `truth_status = asserted_true`. A disputed proposition
remains in $V$ (it can be referenced, queried, and reasoned about) but is excluded
from the asserted graph.

Lifecycle: a predicate instance is typically created as `hypothetical` at first
mention, promoted to `asserted_true` when grounded, and may later become `disputed`
(conflicting sources) or `retracted` (overturned by new evidence).

### Provenance

A predicate instance **may** carry one or more **provenance records** that record how
the assertion was produced. Provenance is realized as a single distinguished field
`provenance` in $\Phi(p)$, typed `tuple[Provenance, ...] | None`, where `Provenance`
is a frozen sub-model whose own fields are required:

- `source` — the origin of the claim: a text span, document reference, or extraction
  method identifier
- `extraction_method` — how the claim was derived: direct quotation, inference, model
  extraction, manual annotation

Grouping provenance into one optional collection — rather than scattering optional
`source`/`extraction_method` fields directly on the statement — is deliberate. It
guarantees there is **no partial provenance**: a statement is *grounded* (carries one
or more complete `Provenance` records) or *ungrounded* (`provenance is None`). "Does
this statement have proper provenance?" is the single boolean
`stmt.provenance is not None`.

Additional provenance fields may be declared per predicate type by subclassing
`Provenance` in $\Phi(p)$. The field `narrator_confidence` in the Holmes schema is one
such extension.

**Grounded vs. ungrounded statements.** A grounded statement traces to a canonical
source or to a derivation (a rule-derived instance carries at least one provenance
record with `extraction_method = inferred`; see §Rule). An ungrounded statement is one introduced
for hypothetical or "what-if" reasoning that never originated in a source document; it
sets `provenance = None`. Ungrounded statements are full members of $V$ — they have an
id, a `truth_status`, and can be referenced and reasoned over — but they are excluded
from any provenance-restricted query.

**The grounded subgraph** — the projection of $E$ where `provenance is not None` — is
the counterpart to the asserted graph. The two projections are independent and
composable: a query may restrict to statements that are both `asserted_true` *and*
grounded when only source-backed facts are acceptable, or admit ungrounded statements
when exploring hypotheticals. Grounding is orthogonal to `truth_status`: an ungrounded
statement may still be `asserted_true` within a hypothetical scenario, and a grounded
statement may be `disputed`.

Provenance fields are instance metadata (R2): they describe how this particular
assertion was produced, not what the predicate type means. The distinction matters:
two instances of the same predicate type may have identical `subject`, `object_`, and
`truth_status` and differ only in provenance. Both are valid, distinct members of $V$
— their ids differ.

This property holds as stated for **pipeline-extracted** instances, where the
extraction pipeline assigns a unique id per extraction event. It does not hold for
**canonical-fact** construction via `statement_id()`, which is content-addressed on
`(subject, predicate_name, object)` alone. In that pattern, re-constructing the same
fact (e.g. from a different paragraph) yields the same id deliberately — re-extraction
is treated as confirmation, not as a new member of $V$. Use `statement_id()` when you
want canonical standing facts that collapse duplicates; assign unique ids per
extraction event when you want a full audit trail of every derivation. The two
patterns should not be mixed within a single loading pass.

**Provenance does not replace truth_status.** A claim with high-confidence provenance
from a reliable source may still be `disputed` (if contradicted) or `retracted` (if
overturned). Truth status is the graph's current epistemic commitment; provenance is
the audit trail behind that commitment.

## Vocabulary

Use these terms consistently throughout the book. Do not treat them as synonyms.

| Term                  | Definition |
|-----------------------|------------|
| **Instance**          | A member of $V$ — the common root of both sorts. Realized as the Python class `Instance`, which carries the `id` field and the frozen model configuration. Every entity instance and every statement is an Instance; nothing else is. |
| **Entity type**       | A member of $T_\text{ent}$. Realized as a Python class inheriting from `EntityInstance`. Defines a class of entities: the fields they carry and their permitted roles in predicates. Example: `Person`, `Location`, `Moment`. |
| **Predicate type**    | A member of $T_\text{pred}$. Realized as a Python class inheriting from `BaseStatement`. Defines a class of propositions: their field schema, domain, range, traits, and truth status. Example: `LocatedIn`, `KnewAt`, `Treats`. |
| **Entity instance**   | A member of $V$ with $\tau(v) \in T_\text{ent}$. A concrete node — an instance of an `EntityInstance` subclass with an `id` and data fields. Example: a specific `Person` instance for Sherlock Holmes. A Statement is *not* an entity instance; both are Instances. |
| **Statement**         | A member of $V$ with $\tau(v) \in T_\text{pred}$. A concrete proposition — an instance of a `BaseStatement` subclass with an `id`, a `subject`, an `object_`, a `truth_status`, and metadata fields. Also a member of $E$ (the derived edge set). The term "edge instance" is an informal synonym when traversing the asserted graph. |
| **Field schema**      | $\Phi(t)$: the Pydantic model declaration of named fields and their types for type $t$. For predicate types, $\Phi$ includes `subject`, `object_`, and `truth_status` as distinguished fields whose type annotations constitute domain, range, and truth semantics. |
| **Domain**            | $\text{dom}(p)$ — the set of types permitted in the subject role for predicate $p$. Read from the type annotation of `subject` in $\Phi(p)$. |
| **Range**             | $\text{ran}(p)$ — the set of types permitted in the object role for predicate $p$. Read from the type annotation of `object_` in $\Phi(p)$. When $\text{ran}(p)$ includes a predicate type (i.e. a `BaseStatement` subclass), predicate $p$ enables higher-order claims. |
| **Trait**             | A declarative semantic property of a predicate type. Member of $\text{Tr}(p)$. Belongs to the schema, not to any instance. Realized as a Python mixin class. |
| **Schema**            | The tuple $(T,\ \Phi)$ together with trait declarations. Fixed at graph-design time. |
| **Instance graph**    | The tuple $(V,\ \tau)$. Populated at ingestion or reasoning time. |
| **Asserted graph**    | The subset of $E$ where `truth_status = asserted_true`, indexed for traversal. The first-order fact graph. |
| **Grounded subgraph** | The subset of $E$ where `provenance is not None` — statements backed by a source or a derivation. Orthogonal to and composable with the asserted graph. Its complement is the ungrounded (hypothetical-origin) statements. |
| **Canonical identifier** | The value of $v.\text{id}$ for instance $v \in V$. Globally unique within $V$, assigned at construction, and immutable. The Python realization is a `str` field on the `Instance` root class. For real-world entities, ids are sourced from authoritative ontologies (community-curated over long periods) rather than minted ad hoc; see the ontology authority declared in the domain section. The id is never parsed to recover type or structure — type is the exclusive responsibility of $\tau$. Human-readable display is the responsibility of `__str__`, which is a separate, one-way presentation artifact. |
| **Provenance**        | An optional non-empty collection of frozen sub-models (`tuple[Provenance, ...] | None`) recording how a predicate instance was produced: its sources, extraction methods, and any confidence scores. Carried as `provenance` on the instance (R2, R10). Either complete (*grounded*) or absent (*ungrounded* — `None`); never partial. Distinct from truth status, which records the graph's current epistemic commitment to the proposition. |

### Terms to avoid or use carefully

- **Edge** — informal synonym for Statement when discussing traversal. Acceptable in casual prose; in definitions, use "Statement" or "predicate instance."
- **Relationship** — use this to mean a predicate instance, never a predicate type.
- **Node** — informal synonym for entity instance. Acceptable in casual prose, not in definitions.
- **Property** — overloaded; could mean a field on an instance or a trait on a predicate type. Be explicit.
- **Entity** — do not use as a synonym for "member of $V$." A Statement is a member of $V$ but is not an entity instance. When V-membership is what's meant, say "Instance."
- **Reification** — in this model, there is nothing to reify. Every predicate instance is already a member of $V$ and can be referenced by any predicate whose range includes its type. The word applies to models where edges and vertices are disjoint sorts; here they are not.

---

## Hard Rules

These rules follow from the formal definition and must not be violated in code
examples, schema designs, or explanatory prose.

**R1. Traits belong to predicate types, never to instances.** A predicate either
has `Transitive` or it does not. That is part of what the predicate *means*. An
individual instance cannot be transitive or non-transitive — that distinction
belongs to its type. In Python, traits are declared by inheriting the trait mixin
class alongside `BaseStatement`.

**R2. Metadata fields belong to instances, never to predicate types.** Provenance,
confidence, timestamps — all of these are facts about a particular assertion. They
live on the instance. The predicate type defines which fields are required (via
$\Phi$), but carries no values itself.

**R3. Every predicate instance is a directed, typed, truth-bearing proposition.**
A predicate instance carries `subject`, `object_`, `truth_status`, and whatever
additional fields $\Phi$ requires. It is simultaneously a proposition (it has
subject, predicate type, and object), a referable member of $V$ (it has an id
and can be referenced), and a potential edge in the asserted graph (if its
truth_status is `asserted_true`).

**R4. Domain and range are sets of types, not instances.** Formally,
$\text{dom}(p) \subseteq T$, not $\subseteq V$. You constrain which *kinds* of
things may appear as subject or object, not which specific things.

**R5. Schema is fixed; instances are populated.** Nothing discovered during
ingestion changes $T$, $\Phi$, domain, range, or traits. If a new type seems
necessary mid-ingestion, that is a schema design problem, not an ingestion problem.

**R6. Domain and range constraints are enforced by the Python type system.** Types
are Python classes. Each predicate class declares its `subject` and `object_` fields
with concrete class annotations. Mypy enforces these constraints statically; Pydantic
enforces them at construction time. When a predicate permits multiple subject or
object types, declare a `Union` (e.g. `subject: Person | Organization`). The field
name `object_` is used throughout to avoid shadowing the Python builtin `object`.

**R7. Pydantic models for instances are frozen.** Use
`model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)`. Instances are facts; they must not be
mutated after construction.

**R8. Higher-order predication is a schema-level type declaration, not a runtime
promotion.** A predicate enables higher-order claims when its range includes a
predicate type (a `BaseStatement` subclass). This is declared once in $\Phi$ at
schema design time — e.g. `object_: BaseStatement` on `KnewAt`. There is no runtime
"promotion" of instances between layers. Every predicate instance is a referable
member of $V$ from birth; whether any other predicate can point at it is determined
by the type declarations in $\Phi$.

The object's concrete predicate type must be **preserved** when it is stored: if a
`WorksFor` instance is the object of a `Believes`, `Believes.object_` must remain a
`WorksFor`, not be silently downcast to `BaseStatement` — otherwise you can no longer
tell *which* proposition is being predicated over (its $\tau$, its traits, its
inverse), which is the whole point of R8. In the Python realization a range of "any
statement" is therefore declared as `InstanceOf[BaseStatement]` (exported as
`AnyStatement`), which validates by `isinstance` and keeps the instance as-is; a
bare or `Any`-parametrized `BaseStatement[...]` range would rebuild the object as the
base class and lose $\tau$. Trade-off: an object supplied as a raw dict is rejected —
statements are reconstructed by the loader and passed as instances.

Do **not** use higher-order predication to attach provenance, confidence, or
epistemic metadata to a proposition. That is R2's job — such fields belong on the
instance directly, declared in $\Phi$. Higher-order predication is for *predicating
over* a proposition (knowing it, disputing it, supporting it), not for *annotating*
one. Using it for annotation reintroduces exactly the overhead this model exists to
reject (see Non-Goals: *Not RDF/OWL*).

**R9. Every instance has a canonical, stable identifier; display is separate.** The
`id` field is assigned at construction and does not change. For entity instances that
correspond to real-world referents, the id should be sourced from or aligned with an
authoritative ontology (community-curated over time, e.g. Wikidata QIDs, MeSH IDs,
or a domain-specific authority such as Baker Street Wiki). Minting ad-hoc IDs for
named entities that have established canonical IDs elsewhere is a traceability failure.

The id string must never be parsed to recover type or relationship structure — type
is the exclusive responsibility of $\tau$ and the Python class hierarchy. Any code
that branches on id content to determine a type is a violation of R6 and R9.

Human-readable id schemes (external ontology keys such as `wiki:Sherlock_Holmes`,
corpus-namespaced slugs) are permitted as long as no code parses them for type
dispatch. Synthetic internal entities (events, moments, plans) with no external
ontology anchor should use corpus-namespaced slugs without a type segment
(e.g. `sib:kings_visit`, not `sib:event:kings_visit`).

*Content-addressed statement ids* are a deliberate exception: `statement_id()`
embeds the predicate name and participant ids (e.g.
`stmt:wiki:Holmes:Knows:wiki:Watson`) for traceability and idempotent
construction. The embedded predicate name is there for debugging, not dispatch —
nothing in the system parses it back to determine a type. This is structurally
different from the discouraged synthetic-entity pattern, where the type segment
carries no information not already provided by Python's class hierarchy.

Human-readable display is the responsibility of `__str__`, not `id`. `__str__`
returns `display_name` for entities that carry one, `description`/`label` for
synthetic entities, and `ClassName(subject → object)` for predicate instances.
It is a one-way presentation artifact — generated for human consumption, never
parsed back.

**R10. Provenance is optional per instance but all-or-nothing in form.** $\Phi(p)$
declares a single `provenance: tuple[Provenance, ...] | None` field for every
$p \in T_\text{pred}$, where `Provenance` is a frozen sub-model requiring at minimum
`source` and `extraction_method`. A statement is either *grounded* (one or more
complete `Provenance` objects) or *ungrounded* (`provenance is None`); partial provenance is impossible by
construction. Ungrounded statements are permitted — they are how the graph represents
hypotheticals that did not originate in a canonical source — but grounding must always
be legible: `stmt.provenance is not None` is the definitive test, and the grounded
subgraph is the projection of $E$ where it holds. Code that needs source-backed facts
must restrict to the grounded subgraph rather than assuming every statement is grounded.

---

## Python Enforcement Pattern

The class hierarchy mirrors the formalism exactly. A single root class,
`Instance`, carries the `id` field and the frozen model configuration — it
realizes membership in $V$. Entity types are `EntityInstance` subclasses;
predicate types are `BaseStatement` subclasses with trait mixins inherited
alongside. `EntityInstance` and `BaseStatement` are disjoint siblings under
`Instance`: the sibling split realizes the strict partition of $T$, and
`BaseStatement` ⊂ `Instance` realizes $E \subseteq V$. A statement is
substitutable wherever "any member of $V$" is expected, and nowhere that
specifically an entity is expected — the type system asserts exactly what is
true and nothing more.

Domain and range constraints are expressed as Pydantic field type annotations —
no custom validation logic is needed. `BaseStatement` is generic over its subject
and object types, so `dom(p)`/`ran(p)` are the type arguments (a `Union` for a
multi-type set). Traits are introspectable at runtime
(`issubclass(LocatedIn, Transitive)`), and `get_inverse` resolves declared inverse
pairs — including partners given as forward references. A range of "any statement"
uses `AnyStatement` (`InstanceOf[BaseStatement]`) so the object keeps its concrete
type. The base package is in `base.py`; a worked domain is in `example.py`.

---

## Non-Goals

**Not RDF / OWL.** In RDF, predicates are URIs and are themselves nodes; the graph
is a flat set of triples with no first-class edge objects. OWL adds description
logic semantics and open-world assumption. This model is a closed-world typed graph
where every predicate instance is a truth-bearing, field-carrying member of $V$. RDF
requires reification or named graphs for higher-order predication; this model
handles it through type declarations on domain and range.

**Not Neo4j's informal property graph.** Neo4j allows arbitrary key-value properties
on edges without schema enforcement. This model requires a declared field schema
($\Phi$) and enforced domain/range constraints. The structure is similar; the
discipline is different.

**Not an entity-relationship diagram.** ER diagrams are a database design tool.
This is a runtime knowledge representation with provenance, epistemic scope, and
trait-based inference semantics.

**Not a general ontology language.** This model does not support open-world reasoning,
class hierarchies, disjointness axioms, or the full OWL trait vocabulary. Traits are
a small, fixed set of declarative properties. If a use case seems to require full
description logic, that is scope creep.

**Not a stringly-typed system.** Types are Python classes, not ID prefixes. Domain
and range enforcement is the job of the Python type system and Pydantic, not of
string parsing. Any code that parses an identifier string to determine or dispatch
on a type is a violation of R6. Human-readable id schemes (external ontology keys,
corpus-namespaced slugs) are not themselves a violation — the violation is parsing
them for type dispatch. Human-readable display is the responsibility of `__str__`,
not `id`.

## Current Domain: Holmes Corpus

The worked example uses the Sherlock Holmes canon as domain.

- **Ontology authority**: Baker Street Wiki (https://bakerstreet.fandom.com)
- **Schema construction method**: inductive — built by annotating stories, not pre-designed
- **Primary stories**: "A Scandal in Bohemia" (complete); "The Speckled Band" (planned)
- **Provisional entity types**: `Person`, `Location`, `Object`, `Document`,
  `Moment`, `Event`, `Persona`, `Plan`
- **Higher-order predicates**: `KnewAt`, `Contradicts` — these take `BaseStatement`
  in their range, enabling epistemic and dispute tracking
- **Epistemic fields on predicate instances**: `moment`, `narrator_confidence`,
  provenance fields
