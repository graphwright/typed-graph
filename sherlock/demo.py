"""Demo loader for Sherlock JSONL data vendored in this repository.

The mystery demo (`solve_mystery`) runs a genuine Horn clause through the
datalog Engine's real API (`add_facts` -> `add_rule` -> `infer`). It reports the
candidate hiding places that *deduction alone* supports, and is explicit about
what deduction cannot do: it cannot, on the current dataset, single out one
place, because the graph contains no edge tying the reveal event to a location.
Ranking the candidates is exactly the job for the probabilistic layer.

    API -- no adapters, no fallbacks. If the rule cannot fire, the demo says so
